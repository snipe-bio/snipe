    Snipe CLI Tool
    =============

    This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) for performing various sketching and quality control operations on genomic data. It leverages the `click` library to handle command-line arguments and supports parallel processing for efficiency.

    Commands:
    - `sketch`: Perform sketching operations on genomic data.
    - `qc`: Execute quality control (QC) on multiple samples against a reference genome.
